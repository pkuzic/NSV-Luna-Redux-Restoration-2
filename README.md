# Note
This project is not in active development, but has been unarchived in case anyone wishes to PR any fixes, be they obvious code errors or just fixes to make the game compile on the latest version of BYOND. Currently it will only compile on BYOND version 515.

# Original readme
Update of an update (of possibly another updated) of the NSV Luna, and now updated again. Don't know who originally made the update, but they deserve most of the credit. Credit also due to Bloxgate for the last updated version of this codebase. For best work experience be sure to check "Automatically Set FILE_DIR for sub-directories" in dream maker.
